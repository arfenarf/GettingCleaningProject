## Data Dictionary - tidy_data.txt

*tidy_data.txt* is a file generated by the script *run_analysis.R*, which aggregates,
tidies, and summarises data files originating from the Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory.  Technical requirements are in the README.md file
accompanying this document.

All values in this file are averages of observations taken from six different
activities over 30 test subjects, summarised by activity and then by subject.
*Only variables that were either themselves averages or standard deviations
were extracted from the original data set to be included here. *

* Variables with "mean" in their names are averages.
* Variables with "std" in their names are standard deviations.


## About The Data 
A full description of the data set and the project are located here:

(taken from 'features_info.txt' from original data set)

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
